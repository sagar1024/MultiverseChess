♟️ Multiverse Chess

Multiverse Chess is a single-player chess variant where every decision creates a new universe.
Instead of committing to one move, the player can explore multiple timelines at once, branching the game into parallel boards while facing a computer-controlled chess engine.

This project blends strategic depth, parallel game states, and AI decision-making into a unique chess experience unlike traditional formats.
