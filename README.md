♟️ Multiverse Chess

Multiverse Chess is a single-player chess variant where every decision creates a new universe.
Instead of committing to one move, the player can explore multiple timelines at once, branching the game into parallel boards while facing a computer-controlled chess engine.

This project blends strategic depth, parallel game states, and AI decision-making into a unique chess experience unlike traditional formats.

Core Concept

In Multiverse Chess, a single move doesn’t just change the board — it creates a new reality.

The player can make up to 3 consecutive moves per turn

Each move may branch the game into a new universe

Every universe is an independent chess board

All universes are evaluated simultaneously to determine the final outcome

The goal is to outperform the engine across timelines, not just on a single board.
